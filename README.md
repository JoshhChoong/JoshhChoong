## ðŸ˜Š About Me! 
I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph and a full-stack developer with an interest building software applications that combat real world problems. If you're ever interested in chatting, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-choong-36677a209/)!

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m Currently Working On...
Right now, I'm primarily working on a web application called Rubber Ducky - a pair programming AI partner designed to assist programmers in honing their intuition for Data Structures and Algorithms (leetcode). I'm also an executive of the Google Developer Student Club where I help coordinate and plan events, and a member of the Guelph Cybersecurity Club and AI Club.
